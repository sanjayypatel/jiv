#Jiv

##A media consumption tracker built in Rails.

Try out the app live at http://jiv.herokuapp.com

Jiv was built to solve a personal need - the need to create lists of all sorts of items. A simple, general form for documenting media I read, watched, heard, and played was all I needed.

###Tracks:

* Books read
* Movies watched
